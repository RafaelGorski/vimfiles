Rafael Gorski's personal vimfiles.

I use vim with junction of Visual Studio's VSVim in a Windows Machine.
I also use OSX however not as dev tool.

Installation instructions (Windows, using Powershell):
- git clone https://github.com/RafaelGorski/vimfiles $env:HOME/vimfiles
- echo "source $($($env:HOME).Replace('\', '/'))/vimfiles/.vimrc" > ~/_vimrc
- cd ~/vimfiles
- git submodule update --init

Have a look to the ~/vimfiles/bundle for more details regarding each vim extension.
